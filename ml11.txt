
### **1. Discrete Random Variable with PMF**

Assume the PMF of \(X\) is given as a probability mass function (PMF) that defines the probability for each possible value of \(X\). Since the actual PMF isn't specified, the general steps for solving the problems would be:

#### 1. **Find the range \( R_X \) of the random variable \( X \):**

- The **range** \( R_X \) is simply the set of all possible values that \(X\) can take. To find it, look at all values in the PMF for which \( P(X = x) \) is non-zero.

#### 2. **Find \( P(X \leq 0.5) \):**

- This is the probability that \(X\) is less than or equal to 0.5. Calculate this by summing the PMF over all values \( x \leq 0.5 \). 
  \[
  P(X \leq 0.5) = \sum_{x \leq 0.5} P(X = x)
  \]

#### 3. **Find \( P(0.25 < X < 0.75) \):**

- This is the probability that \( X \) takes a value strictly between 0.25 and 0.75. Compute the sum of probabilities for all \( x \) that satisfy \( 0.25 < x < 0.75 \).

#### 4. **Find \( P(X = 0.2 | X < 0.6) \):**

- This is the conditional probability that \( X = 0.2 \) given that \( X < 0.6 \).
  \[
  P(X = 0.2 | X < 0.6) = \frac{P(X = 0.2)}{P(X < 0.6)}
  \]

### **2. Two Equal and Fair Dice**

#### 1. **Find \( R_X \), \( R_Y \), and the PMFs of \( X \) and \( Y \):**

- When two fair dice are rolled, \( X \) and \( Y \) are the numbers rolled on each die, and the range \( R_X \) and \( R_Y \) for both variables are \( \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\} \).
- Since each die has 6 faces, each value has a probability of \( \frac{1}{6} \) for \( X \) and \( Y \), i.e., 
  \[
  P(X = x) = P(Y = y) = \frac{1}{6} \quad \text{for } x, y \in \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}
  \]

#### 2. **Find \( P(X = 2, Y = 6) \):**

- The two dice are independent, so the probability of \( X = 2 \) and \( Y = 6 \) is the product of their individual probabilities:
  \[
  P(X = 2, Y = 6) = P(X = 2) \times P(Y = 6) = \frac{1}{6} \times \frac{1}{6} = \frac{1}{36}
  \]

#### 3. **Find \( P(X > 3 | Y = 2) \):**

- This is the conditional probability that \( X > 3 \) given that \( Y = 2 \). Since \( X \) and \( Y \) are independent, the conditional probability is:
  \[
  P(X > 3 | Y = 2) = P(X > 3) = P(X = 4, 5, 6) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}
  \]

#### 4. **If \( Z = X + Y \), Find the range and PMF of \( Z \):**

- The range of \( Z \) is the sum of the ranges of \( X \) and \( Y \), so \( R_Z = \{2, 3, 4, ..., 12\} \).
- The PMF of \( Z \) will depend on how the sums of the values of \( X \) and \( Y \) combine. For each possible value \( z \), \( P(Z = z) \) is the sum of the probabilities for all pairs \( (x, y) \) such that \( x + y = z \).

#### 5. **Find \( P(X = 4 | Z = 8) \):**

- This is a conditional probability where \( Z = 8 \). The value \( X = 4 \) is one of the pairs that gives \( Z = 8 \) (since \( X + Y = 8 \), then \( Y = 4 \) as well). Thus:
  \[
  P(X = 4 | Z = 8) = \frac{P(X = 4, Y = 4)}{P(Z = 8)}
  \]

### **3. Exam with Multiple-Choice Questions**

The student knows the answers to 10 questions, and for the other 10, he chooses randomly from 44 possible answers. This is a **binomial distribution** problem for the random variable \( X \) (the total number of correct answers from the 10 unknown questions).

Let the number of correct answers on the random questions be \( X_{\text{random}} \sim \text{Binomial}(10, \frac{1}{44}) \).

The PMF of \( X \) is:
\[
P(X = k) = \binom{10}{k} \left( \frac{1}{44} \right)^k \left( 1 - \frac{1}{44} \right)^{10-k}
\]
where \( k \) is the number of correct answers.

To calculate \( P(X > 15) \), sum the probabilities for \( X = 16, 17, ..., 20 \).

### **4. Poisson Distribution for Student Arrivals**

Given that the number of students arriving at a college follows a Poisson distribution with an average of 10 students per hour, and \( Y \) represents the number of students arriving from 10 am to 11:30 am (1.5 hours):

- The Poisson parameter for this period is \( \lambda = 10 \times 1.5 = 15 \).

Thus, \( Y \sim \text{Poisson}(15) \), and we need to calculate \( P(10 < Y \leq 15) \), which is:
\[
P(10 < Y \leq 15) = P(Y = 11) + P(Y = 12) + \dots + P(Y = 15)
\]
where the PMF of a Poisson random variable is given by:
\[
P(Y = k) = \frac{\lambda^k e^{-\lambda}}{k!}
\]
for \( k = 11, 12, ..., 15 \).

---

### **5. Sum of Independent Poisson Variables**

Given that \( X \sim \text{Poisson}(\alpha) \) and \( Y \sim \text{Poisson}(\beta) \), the random variable \( Z = X + Y \) follows a Poisson distribution with parameter \( \lambda = \alpha + \beta \). Thus:
\[
Z \sim \text{Poisson}(\alpha + \beta)
\]
The PMF of \( Z \) is:
\[
P(Z = z) = \frac{(\alpha + \beta)^z e^{-(\alpha + \beta)}}{z!}
\]
for \( z = 0, 1, 2, \dots \).

---

### **6. Transformation of Random Variables**

#### 1. **Find the range of \( Y = (X + 1)^2 \):**

- If \( X \) has values \( \{ x_1, x_2, \dots \} \), then the range of \( Y \) is the set of values \( (x + 1)^2 \) for each \( x \).

#### 2. **Find the PMF of \( Y \):**

- If \( Y = (X + 1)^2 \), then \( P(Y = y) = P(X = \sqrt{y} - 1) \), assuming \( X \) takes integer values.

---

### **7. Joint PDF of Two Continuous Random Variables**

This would involve solving for the marginal PDFs \( f_X(a) \) and \( f_Y(b) \), checking for independence, and finding the conditional PDF \( f_{A|B}(a|b) \).

---

### **8. Total Weight on a Ship**

Given the weights of the men on a ship, and the distribution of their weights being normal, we use the **central limit theorem (CLT)** to approximate the probability that the total weight exceeds 18,000 pounds. The total weight would follow a normal distribution with mean \( \mu_{\text{total}} = 100 \times 170 \) and standard deviation \( \sigma_{\text{total}} = \sqrt{100} \times 30 \).

---

### **9. Central Limit Theorem**

Given that \( X_1, X_2, \dots, X_{25} \) are independent and identically distributed, we can approximate the probability \( P(4 \leq Y \leq 6) \) using the central limit theorem, as \( Y \) is the sum of independent random variables.
