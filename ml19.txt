### **1. K-Means Clustering with Given Data**

#### Data Points: 
5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35  
Assume that \(k = 2\) and the two sets of initial centroids are:

- **Set 1 Centroids:** 15, 32
- **Set 2 Centroids:** 12, 30

#### a) Create Two Clusters for Each Set of Centroids:

##### **First Set of Centroids (15, 32):**

1. **Cluster 1 (Centroid 15):** 
   - Assign the data points to the cluster whose centroid is closest.
   - Data points closer to 15 are: 5, 10, 15
2. **Cluster 2 (Centroid 32):** 
   - Data points closer to 32 are: 20, 25, 30, 35

So, the clusters would be:

- **Cluster 1:** 5, 10, 15
- **Cluster 2:** 20, 25, 30, 35

##### **Second Set of Centroids (12, 30):**

1. **Cluster 1 (Centroid 12):**
   - Data points closer to 12 are: 5, 10, 15
2. **Cluster 2 (Centroid 30):**
   - Data points closer to 30 are: 20, 25, 30, 35

So, the clusters would again be:

- **Cluster 1:** 5, 10, 15
- **Cluster 2:** 20, 25, 30, 35

#### b) Calculate the SSE for Each Set of Centroids:

SSE is calculated by summing the squared distances between each data point and the centroid of its respective cluster.

##### **For Set 1 (Centroids 15, 32):**

- **Cluster 1 (Centroid 15):**
  \[
  SSE_1 = (5 - 15)^2 + (10 - 15)^2 + (15 - 15)^2 = 100 + 25 + 0 = 125
  \]
  
- **Cluster 2 (Centroid 32):**
  \[
  SSE_2 = (20 - 32)^2 + (25 - 32)^2 + (30 - 32)^2 + (35 - 32)^2 = 144 + 49 + 4 + 9 = 206
  \]

- **Total SSE for Set 1:**
  \[
  SSE_{\text{total}} = 125 + 206 = 331
  \]

##### **For Set 2 (Centroids 12, 30):**

- **Cluster 1 (Centroid 12):**
  \[
  SSE_1 = (5 - 12)^2 + (10 - 12)^2 + (15 - 12)^2 = 49 + 4 + 9 = 62
  \]
  
- **Cluster 2 (Centroid 30):**
  \[
  SSE_2 = (20 - 30)^2 + (25 - 30)^2 + (30 - 30)^2 + (35 - 30)^2 = 100 + 25 + 0 + 25 = 150
  \]

- **Total SSE for Set 2:**
  \[
  SSE_{\text{total}} = 62 + 150 = 212
  \]

### **2. How Market Basket Research Uses Association Analysis Concepts:**

Market Basket Research uses **association analysis** to discover patterns or relationships between different items in a customer's shopping basket. The goal is to identify **frequent item sets** and generate **association rules**, which are statements like "If a customer buys item A, they are likely to buy item B." 

- **Application:** In retail, if many customers buy both bread and butter together, retailers might place these items closer to each other in the store or offer discounts for bundling them.

---

### **3. Example of the Apriori Algorithm for Learning Association Rules:**

**Problem:**
Given a dataset of customer transactions, we want to find association rules.

**Transactions:**
1. {Milk, Bread, Butter}
2. {Milk, Butter}
3. {Bread, Butter}
4. {Milk, Bread}
5. {Bread, Butter, Cheese}

**Step 1: Find frequent item sets with a minimum support (e.g., 60% support).**

- Milk appears in 3 out of 5 transactions, so it is a frequent item.
- Bread appears in 4 out of 5 transactions, so it is a frequent item.
- Butter appears in 4 out of 5 transactions, so it is a frequent item.
- The pair {Milk, Bread} appears in 2 out of 5 transactions, so it is a frequent item pair.

**Step 2: Generate association rules (with minimum confidence).**
- Rule: {Milk} ? {Bread} (Confidence: 2/3 = 66.7%)
- Rule: {Bread} ? {Milk} (Confidence: 2/4 = 50%)

### **4. How Distance Between Clusters is Measured in Hierarchical Clustering:**

- **Distance Metric:** The distance between clusters is typically measured using:
  - **Single Link:** The shortest distance between any pair of points in the two clusters.
  - **Complete Link:** The longest distance between any pair of points in the two clusters.
  - **Average Link:** The average distance between all pairs of points, one from each cluster.
  
- **Deciding When to End Iteration:** 
  - Clustering stops when all points belong to a single cluster or when the distance between the closest clusters exceeds a threshold.

---

### **5. How to Recompute Cluster Centroids in K-Means Algorithm:**

- After assigning data points to clusters, the centroid of each cluster is recalculated by computing the mean of the data points assigned to that cluster.

For cluster \( C_i \):
\[
\mu_i = \frac{1}{|C_i|} \sum_{x_j \in C_i} x_j
\]
Where \( |C_i| \) is the number of data points in cluster \( C_i \), and \( x_j \) is each data point in the cluster.

---

### **6. Method for Determining the Number of Clusters in K-Means:**

- **Elbow Method:** Plot the SSE for different values of \(k\) and identify the "elbow" point where the SSE starts to decrease at a slower rate. This point suggests the optimal number of clusters.

---

### **7. Advantages and Disadvantages of K-Means Algorithm:**

- **Advantages:**
  - Simple and easy to implement.
  - Efficient for large datasets.
  - Works well when clusters are spherical and equally sized.

- **Disadvantages:**
  - Sensitive to initial centroid positions.
  - Struggles with clusters of varying sizes and densities.
  - Not ideal for clusters with irregular shapes.

---

### **8. Diagram to Demonstrate the Principle of Clustering:**

A simple diagram would show several data points distributed across a 2D plane, with different colors representing different clusters. The centroids of the clusters would be marked as the centers of each group.

---

### **9. Second Iteration of K-Means Clustering:**

- **Cluster C1 (2, 2), (4, 4), (6, 6):** New centroid:
  \[
  \mu_1 = \left( \frac{2 + 4 + 6}{3}, \frac{2 + 4 + 6}{3} \right) = (4, 4)
  \]

- **Cluster C2 (0, 4), (4, 0), (0, 4), (0, 4):** New centroid:
  \[
  \mu_2 = \left( \frac{0 + 4 + 0 + 0}{4}, \frac{4 + 0 + 4 + 4}{4} \right) = (1, 3)
  \]

- **Cluster C3 (5, 5), (9, 9):** New centroid:
  \[
  \mu_3 = \left( \frac{5 + 9}{2}, \frac{5 + 9}{2} \right) = (7, 7)
  \]

**SSE Calculation:**
- Compute the SSE for each cluster by finding the squared distances between data points and their new centroids.

### **10. Diagram Explaining Defect Clustering in a Software Project:**

A simple diagram would show 20 defect data points clustered into 5 groups. New defect points can then be classified into one of these 5 existing clusters based on similarity.
