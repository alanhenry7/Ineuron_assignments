1. What does RGBA stand for?

RGBA stands for Red, Green, Blue, and Alpha. The first three represent color channels, while the Alpha channel controls transparency.
2. From the Pillow module, how do you get the RGBA value of any image?

You use a method that retrieves the color values at a specific pixel coordinate.
Code:

python
rgba_value = image.getpixel((x, y))  # Get RGBA value at position (x, y)
3. What is a box tuple, and how does it work?

A box tuple is a four-element tuple that defines a rectangular region in an image. It consists of (left, upper, right, lower), where each value represents pixel positions to specify a cropped or selected area.
4. How can you find out the width and height of an Image object?

You access its size attribute, which returns the dimensions of the image in pixels.
Code:

python
width, height = image.size
5. What method would you call to get an Image object for a 100×100 image, excluding the lower-left quarter of it?

You crop it using a box tuple that represents the remaining area of the image, excluding the unwanted section.
Code:

python
cropped_image = image.crop((50, 0, 100, 100))  # Cropping the image excluding the lower-left quarter
6. After making changes to an Image object, how could you save it as an image file?

You use a method that allows saving it in a specified file format like PNG or JPEG.
Code:

python
7. What module contains Pillow’s shape-drawing code?

The ImageDraw module, which allows drawing shapes like lines, rectangles, and circles on images.
8. Image objects do not have drawing methods. What kind of object does? How do you get this kind of object?

The ImageDraw.Draw object provides drawing methods. You can get it by passing an Image object to ImageDraw.Draw.
Code:

python

draw = ImageDraw.Draw(image)  # Create a drawing object
draw.line((0, 0, 100, 100), fill="red", width=5)  # Example drawing operation
