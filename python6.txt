**Assignment Questions and Answers**  

1. **What are escape characters, and how do you use them?**  
   Escape characters are special characters used to insert characters that are difficult to include in a string, such as newlines or quotes. They are written with a backslash (`\`).  
   Example:  
   ```python
   print("This is a \"quoted\" word.")  # Output: This is a "quoted" word.
   ```  

2. **What do the escape characters `\n` and `\t` stand for?**  
   - `\n` stands for a **newline** (moves to the next line).  
   - `\t` stands for a **tab space**.  

3. **What is the way to include backslash characters in a string?**  
   To include a backslash (`\`), escape it using another backslash:  
   ```python
   print("This is a backslash: \\")
   ```  

4. **The string `"Howl's Moving Castle"` is a correct value. Why isn't the single quote character in the word `Howl's` not escaped a problem?**  
   The string is enclosed in **double quotes (`" "`)**, so the single quote (`'`) inside does not cause an issue. If the string were enclosed in single quotes (`' '`), the quote inside would need to be escaped.  

5. **How do you write a string of newlines if you donâ€™t want to use the `\n` character?**  
   Use triple quotes (`""" """` or `''' '''`) to create a multiline string:  
   ```python
   print("""This is
   a multiline
   string.""")
   ```  

6. **What are the values of the given expressions?**  
   ```python
   'Hello, world!'[1]      # 'e'
   'Hello, world!'[0:5]    # 'Hello'
   'Hello, world!'[:5]     # 'Hello'
   'Hello, world!'[3:]     # 'lo, world!'
   ```  

7. **What are the values of the following expressions?**  
   ```python
   'Hello'.upper()            # 'HELLO'
   'Hello'.upper().isupper()  # True
   'Hello'.upper().lower()    # 'hello'
   ```  

8. **What are the values of the following expressions?**  
   ```python
   'Remember, remember, the fifth of July.'.split()  
   # ['Remember,', 'remember,', 'the', 'fifth', 'of', 'July.']

   '-'.join('There can only one.'.split())  
   # 'There-can-only-one.'
   ```  

9. **What are the methods for right-justifying, left-justifying, and centering a string?**  
   - **Right-justify**: `rjust(width)`  
   - **Left-justify**: `ljust(width)`  
   - **Center**: `center(width)`  
   ```python
   text = "Hello"
   print(text.rjust(10))  # '     Hello'
   print(text.ljust(10))  # 'Hello     '
   print(text.center(10)) # '  Hello   '
   ```  

10. **What is the best way to remove whitespace characters from the start or end?**  
    - `strip()` removes whitespace from both ends.  
    - `lstrip()` removes whitespace from the left.  
    - `rstrip()` removes whitespace from the right.  
    ```python
    text = "  Hello  "
    print(text.strip())  # 'Hello'
    print(text.lstrip()) # 'Hello  '
    print(text.rstrip()) # '  Hello'
    ```
