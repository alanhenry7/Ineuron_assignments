
**Question 1: Return 2 if n is odd and 8 if n is even, using only arithmetic operators.**

```python
def f(n):
    return 2 + (n % 2) * 6

# Test Cases
print(f(1))  # ? 2
print(f(2))  # ? 8
print(f(3))  # ? 2
```

Explanation: The expression `(n % 2)` returns `0` if `n` is even and `1` if `n` is odd. So, when `n` is odd, `2 + (1) * 6` results in `2`, and when `n` is even, `2 + (0) * 6` results in `8`.

**Question 2: Majority vote in a list.**

```python
from collections import Counter

def majority_vote(lst):
    count = Counter(lst)
    majority_count = len(lst) // 2
    for item, freq in count.items():
        if freq > majority_count:
            return item
    return None

# Test Cases
print(majority_vote(["A", "A", "B"]))  # ? "A"
print(majority_vote(["A", "A", "A", "B", "C", "A"]))  # ? "A"
print(majority_vote(["A", "B", "B", "A", "C", "C"]))  # ? None
```

Explanation: We use `Counter` from the `collections` module to count the frequency of each element. If any element occurs more than half the length of the list, it is returned. If no element qualifies, `None` is returned.

**Question 3: Censor specific words from a string.**

```python
def censor_string(txt, lst, char):
    words = txt.split()
    for i in range(len(words)):
        if words[i].lower() in [word.lower() for word in lst]:
            words[i] = char * len(words[i])
    return ' '.join(words)

# Test Cases
print(censor_string("Today is a Wednesday!", ["Today", "a"], "-"))  # ? "----- is - Wednesday!"
print(censor_string("The cow jumped over the moon.", ["cow", "over"], ""))  # ? "The ** jumped ** the moon."
print(censor_string("Why did the chicken cross the road?", ["Did", "chicken", "road"], ""))  # ? "Why ** the *** cross the **?"
```

Explanation: The `split` function breaks the string into words. For each word, we check if it is in the list `lst`, ignoring case, and replace it with the censor character repeated to match the length of the word.

**Question 4: Polydivisible number check.**

```python
def is_polydivisible(n):
    num_str = str(n)
    for i in range(1, len(num_str) + 1):
        if int(num_str[:i]) % i != 0:
            return False
    return True

# Test Cases
print(is_polydivisible(1232))  # ? True
print(is_polydivisible(123220))  # ? False
```

Explanation: We convert the number to a string and check if the number formed by the first `i` digits is divisible by `i` for every position in the number.

**Question 5: Sum of all prime numbers in a list.**

```python
def is_prime(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def sum_primes(lst):
    return sum(num for num in lst if is_prime(num))

# Test Cases
print(sum_primes([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]))  # ? 17
print(sum_primes([2, 3, 4, 11, 20, 50, 71]))  # ? 87
print(sum_primes([]))  # ? None
```

Explanation: The `is_prime` function checks if a number is prime by dividing it by every number from `2` to its square root. The `sum_primes` function sums all prime numbers in the list.
